| First thoughts about the project and how to solve it.
| Online research to gain more information about the thought behind a .proto file and how to implement it correctly.
| Colors: We decided to make the colors of the GridPane compatible with the coloring of the VBox.

| Implementing a background image: Firstly, we wanted to choose a background-image of the Border Pane directly in the
| SceneBuilder but this was not possible because the file path couldn’t be reached/decoded.
| Then we tried to solve this problem by creating a new .css file but this solution didn’t work either,
| the Border Pane was still blank. After some depressed moments we decided to implement ImageView and Paste the pictures
| into the course repository, so the application is independent of the infrastructure where it is started
| (otherwise it would not be possible to find the pictures when running the application on another computer if the
| pictures would be saved locally). Many websites (e.g. https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/layout/style_css.htm) have been
| a big help.

| Implementing a Save and a Load Button: We inspired us by the way how the “New Game” button was designed and figured
| out that the destination file is the “BattleShipFxController.scala”. Our first thoughts were that we need to implement
| a Serializable interface in order to convert an objects state to a byte stream so that the stream can be reverted back
| into a copy of the object. Then write the object to a file and afterwards read the file back again. We implemented
| this part in a new Java Class called SaveSerializable combined with another Java Class SomeMagic. This variation
| appears to be very complex, reducing the performance of the application (this is the reason why we probably won't
| implement theese classes in the final version of the project).
| After a longer search we figured out that also the file “BattleShipGame.scala” is essential for a successful
| implementation of the two buttons after searching for the source code of “init”.

| First try to implement a .proto file. Our online research gave us some hints, including the prediction that the .proto
| file is a subjective and individually built but very important part of the project. We will be working more on this
| file to produce an effective and working version.
| Ongoing search for a solution to the Save/Load - Task

| Creating the Persistence Protocol in order to explain our decisions towards our .proto file and to describe our
| thoughts. What makes Protocol buffers such a powerful feature?
| Fixing bugs with the wish to get a functional Save and Load button.

| Finally solving our problem with the Save- and Load- functions by implementing the Scala feature FileChooser. After a
| long fight with the syntax we found a functional way and were the happiest persons alive. Our biggest unsecurity was
| to decide whether we have to save the game state in a special file format or maybe we could skip this part and hope
| the Application will work properly even without answering this question.

| Last changes on the design, finishing the timesheet file and trying to implement the slider. After some moments we
| decided to delete this slider because it caused too many errors and did not want to work.
| This assignment was a challenge for us but we are proud of us for being able to finish most of the tasks.
