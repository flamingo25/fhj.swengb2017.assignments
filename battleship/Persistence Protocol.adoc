After compiling the BattleShipFX and BattleShipModel part of our assignment repository a suitable protobuf file was a
necessity to get the BattleShipFxApp running.
Service-oriented architecture (protocol buffers) is a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured
data. Serialization describes the process of converting a project to a suitable (binary) format in which it can be stored
for example in a file as it has to be done in our assignment.


Our example:

syntax = "proto3"; --> proto3 is the new "edition" which supports more programming languages

package at.fhj.swengb.apps.battleship;

option java_package         = "at.fhj.swengb.apps.battleship";  --> for which package is the .proto file executed

option java_outer_classname = "BattleShipProtobuf";             --> classname definition


    message BattleShipGame {                --> messages used to specify how the BattleShipGame components should be
        BattleField battlefield = 1;            structured
        repeated BattlePos order = 2;
    }

    enum Direction {                        --> this message is of type enum because this data type allows a variable to
        Horizontal = 0;                         be a set of predefined constants which is essencial for the vessel direction
        Vertical = 1;                           (orientation) to work properly. We have created this message according to
    }                                           knowledge we gained by studying of the MazeRunner .proto file.

    message BattlePos {                     --> this message describes the value battlePos (position of the battle) with
        int32 x = 1;                            only two logical members: x and y with descading values chosen after a couple
        int32 y = 2;                            of hours of playing battlShipGame in the course repository
    }

    message BattleField {                   --> this messsage describes the design of the battleField (= where the "ship
        int32 width = 1;                        battle" takes place). Only three components influence the structure of the
        int32 height = 2;                       field. Of course the width and the height of the field have to be part of
        Fleet fleet = 3;                        this message. Also the fleet placed on the battlefield is esssential
    }                                           because we are not allowed to forget any ships.


    message Fleet {                         --> this message describes the fleet. We decided for an additional message
        repeated Vessel vessels = 1;            for the fleet in order to describe it's components = the vessels (ships)
    }


    message Vessel {                        --> this message is the last step of the nested messages describing the vessels
        string name = 1;                        by defining the name (one word = string should do it), the starting Position,
        BattlePos startPos = 2;                 in which direction the ship "grows" and how big the vessel actually is.
        Direction direction = 3;
        int32 size = 4;
        }


We have chosen this types of messages with the certain values because of hints Mr. Ladst√§tter has hidden in the description
of this Home Assignment and inspired us by the .proto file he created for the MazeRunner Application. Other attributes
would not be important enough to have an influence on the structure of the game.
